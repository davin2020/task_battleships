# Task Battleships - Pick Tasks at Random

## About
I made this website to help people in an online 
[community coworking group](https://lu.ma/u/communitycoworking)
to decide what task to work on next.

You can add tasks to a battleship grid, then select a square at random to reveal the task you could do next. 

The grid caters for a scenario where you have one major project to work on eg a uni dissertation and also want to fit in some smaller tasks eg tidying, laundry etc. Or you can fill in the whole grid with smaller tasks <!-- taking 30-45mins -->

## Live Demo

## Tech
Vanilla JavaScript + HTML + CSS

I purposefully decided not to store any data on the server side, so used JavaScript to hold the task data in an array in the client's browser.

## Install
