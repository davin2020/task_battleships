# DeLorean themed Template for a Random Quote Generator
This is a GitHub Template that you can reuse and customise, to create your own Random Quote Generator.

As I made it pre-Christmas, it also has a snowing effect toggle button

## Install
1. Click the green `Use This Template` button above, and give your repo a name 
2. Clone the new repo locally & `cd` to the new directory
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser

## Customise
You can customise this template in the following ways

- Add your own text/quotes to the `randomQuotes` array in the `script.js` file

- Add your own images to the `randomImages` array in the `script.js` file, and also add them to the `/images` directory

- Add your own font class in `style.css` instead of the current one `font_merienda` (you may wish to adjust the font-size and/or line-height if you change the font)

- Add your own picture-frame SVG image, in the `frame` class in `style.css` (you may wish to adjust the slice options depending on your SVG)

- Adjust the background colours 

<!-- - Hide/remove the Snowing Toggle button -->
